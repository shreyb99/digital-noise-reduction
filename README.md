# Noise Reduction using Digital Filters for Hearing Aids
This was my project for Signals and Systems course. Here, I have attempted to reduce Noise in input signals of Hearing Aids. As most hearing aids are small devices where adding physical chips for filters would add more complexity, this project aims to reduce noise using digital filters.

Filters used are - Butterworth Filter(various orders), Chebyshev and Elliptic Filters.

Basic Flowchart = Input Signal with Noise goes through --> Noise Reduction Filter --> Frequency Shaper --> Amplitude Compression --> Output Signal
